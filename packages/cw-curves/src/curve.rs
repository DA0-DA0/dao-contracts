/// I am struggling on what type to use for the math. Tokens are often stored as Uint128,
/// but they may have 6 or 9 digits. When using constant or linear functions, this doesn't matter
/// much, but for non-linear functions a lot more. Also, supply and reserve most likely have different
/// decimals... either we leave it for the callers to normalize and accept a `Decimal` input,
/// or we pass in `Uint128` as well as the decimal places for supply and reserve.
///
/// After working the first route and realizing that `Decimal` is not all that great to work with
/// when you want to do more complex math than add and multiply `Uint128`, I decided to go the second
/// route. That made the signatures quite complex and my final idea was to pass in `supply_decimal`
/// and `reserve_decimal` in the curve constructors.
