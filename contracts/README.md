# DAO Contracts

- `dao-dao-core` - the core module for DAOs.
- `external` - contracts used by DAOs that are not part of a DAO
  module.
- `pre-propose` - pre-propose modules.
- `proposal` - proposal modules.
- `voting` - voting modules.
- `staking` - cw20 staking functionality and a staking rewards
  system. These contracts are used by [Wasmswap](https://github.com/Wasmswap) as well as DAO DAO.

For a description of each module type, see [our wiki](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-Contracts-Design).
