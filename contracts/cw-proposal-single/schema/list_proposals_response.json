This implies that the condition for passing should be `yes_votes >= total_votes * threshold`.\n\nWith this in mind, how should a user specify that they would like proposals to pass if the majority of voters choose yes? Selecting a 50% passing threshold with those rules doesn't properly cover that case as 5 voters voting yes out of 10 would pass the proposal. Selecting 50.0001% or or some variation of that also does not work as a very small yes vote which technically makes the majority yes may not reach that threshold.\n\nTo handle these cases we provide both a majority and percent option for all percentages. If majority is selected passing will be determined by `yes > total_votes * 0.5`. If percent is selected passing is determined by `yes >= total_votes * percent`.\n\nIn both of these cases a proposal with only abstain votes must fail. This requires a special case passing logic.",
